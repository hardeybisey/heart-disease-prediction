# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation



# 1) Problem definition

> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict if they have heart disease or not.


# 2) Data
> The data was gotten from a public source and was downloaded from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data'>kaggle</a>

# 3) Evaluation 

>if we can reach a 95% accuracy at predicting wheter or not a patient has heart disease during the machine learning process, we will pursue the project

# 4) Features

> 1. age (Age of the patient in years)
> 2. sex (Male/Female)
> 3. cp chest pain type ([0 :typical angina, 1:atypical angina, 2:non-anginal, 3:asymptomatic])
> 4.trestbps resting blood pressure (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
> 5. chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
> 6. fbs (if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
> 7.restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
> 8.thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
> 9.exang: exercise-induced angina (True/ False)
> 10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
> 11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
> 12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
> 13. thal: [normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]
> 14. target : the predicted attribute
